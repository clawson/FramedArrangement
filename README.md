# FramedArrangement
DevMountain pre-course work.  Project #7 - FramedArrangement

This is fairly rudimentary.  My "squares" are rectangles since I am using the entire screen.

I also have a couple of things that I want to improve.  It seems like some of the code can be done in a loop, but I haven't played with doing so yet.
